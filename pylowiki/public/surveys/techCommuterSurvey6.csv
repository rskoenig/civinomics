I'm ambitious and currently making a good deal less than I anticipate ultimately making. Given that salaries in Santa Cruz tend to be lower than over the hill and given that lower salaries make it more difficult to get a higher salary at the next turn it's hard to justify working here.

It is the nature of the maturity of the companies that grow here many are young and small enough to not require much in the way of operational processes or the engineers perform a DevOps role and try to do things themselves. As companies mature hopefully there will be more opportunities for the foundational tech areas like IT.     It would be great to see Santa Cruz attract the satellite offices for established larger companies as well - I know startups in SF that are expanding to other offices to take advantage of engineering talent from other companies or strong universities(like that which comes out of Stanford...or Baskin?) but are overlooking Santa Cruz as an option despite all the obvious lifestyle/cultural benefits and proximity to Silicon Valley and SF. Attracting some of these to house some daily operations in Santa Cruz would increase interaction and cross-pollination with the locally grown startup companies and products.    Also as a working mom/woman in tech I will add that there would be huge benefits for employers and the community in developing programs to train the large number of underemployed women in SC who are stay at home moms or looking for part-time flexible work or trying to re-enter the workforce after childrearing years. Train these eager available resources be mindful of their family demands in offering them flexibility and project-based work that can be done remotely or in evenings and watch the productivity of the entire SC tech world accelerate. Companies in general could attract more talented women by looking for aptitudes rather than strict skillsets - drop the long list of programming languages or OS expertise required and get the people in that can learn quickly that have passion and curiosity and focus. In my experience someone who comes into a role with a true beginner's mind is the most useful trait of all - they tend to ask the best most relevant questions and have the most end-user insights; they can drive changes in process and product you might never have imagined.,Information about tech job openings in Santa Cruz The results of this survey when they are made public72232282,3/5/14 3:17,3/5/14 3:28,90,Car (single occupancy),(blank),Operations,Operations,5,Team Member,150000,Salary and stock compensation,Cost of living,No,No,12,Yes,Better opportunity over the hill,Equivalent,Nothing,Yes,Have not attended an event,(blank),Married,Yes,Own,34,Talk with VCs more. a big reason startups are in the peninsula and SF is distance from VC offices. Get them to move to Santa Cruz and you will definitely see startup growth here.    Historically Santa Cruz has been bad to their startups and bigger tech companies. many people remember Borland Texas Instruments any of our small ISPs from the late 90s/early 2000s. Both wanted to build more and expand locally. The perception was the city and county made it so difficult to build new space that it was cheaper to move jobs.    Another thing I learned is that folks living in San Jose and that side of the hill hate driving the scary HWY 17 mountain hwy. I never understood this but i'm not also not fearful of this stretch of highway.    Getting the word out on startups on sites like hackernews valleywag venturebeat will attract attention.

We're never going to compete with the valley but the opportunity to be considered a part of the valley has always been there. We need an open collaborative process to create a set of concrete objectives and a strategic plan. We must then manage it in an open collaborative way to avoid a tyranny-of-the-few situation which often naturally evolves. To increase the possibility of success the process of creating and managing the implementation of the plan will be almost as important as the plan itself--and trust me I understand how odd that
