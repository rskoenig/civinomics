## Big ##
### Medium-big ###
#### Medium-small ####
##### Smaller #####
###### smallest


Links
-----

Raw links: <http://civinomics.com>

Links with [text](http://civinomics.com).

You can add hover words(which show up under the cursor), 
[like this](http://civ.io "Hovering text").

Text
------

There are 2 ways to emphasize text: 

*like this* or _like this_ 

Blank lines separate paragraphs.


Quoting
----------
> This is quoted *like email*
Even though this line doesn't have the '>' character, 
it's still part of the same paragraph, so it's still quoted.

This paragraph is not quoted.

Literal text
----------------

You can use `*backquotes*` to mark certain sections as literal text 
(Note it is not italicized)

    You can apply this to entire paragraphs by starting with four spaces
    These two lines start off with four spaces.

Lists
--------
Bulleted lists

* Asterisks
* make
* unordered
* lists

Numbered lists

1. numbers
2. make
3. numbered
4. lists
1. the number used does not matter

Images
----------
You can add inline images hosted elsewhere, with alt text, 
like this:

![alt text](https://civinomics.com/images/logo.png "Civinomics Logo")

Note that images are not supported in comments.
