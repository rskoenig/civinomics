WHAT GOES HERE?
---------------
All civinomics-specific LESS files go into this directory.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------
When you're done editing a file, make sure it's
imported in the main ../civinomics.less file.
Then recompile the main .less file.

CONVENTIONS
-----------
Style and Layout:
LESS files should be split into two parts, one for
the style, and another for the layout.
Example - I might want to create a new element with
class "foo" and style it. Under "layout" I'd put
something like '.foo {padding: 5px;}' and under
"style", '.foo {color: blue;}'
Also see ./columns.less

Naming classes:
All civinomics-specific classes should be prefixed with civ-.
Example - if I want to style a header, I will
do something like <h2 class="civ-col">Blah blah</h2>.


THOUGHTS
--------
Since saving one file and compiling another
gets annoying, use https://github.com/Thimoteus/watchtowr
It will recompile a LESS file when it detects any changes
to the @import'ed files.
