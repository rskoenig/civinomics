Dear ${c.listenerName},

A Civinomics Community Curator for your area has added you
as a Listener for the ${c.listenerScope}.

Civinomics is an online space for promoting civic participation.
Listeners are experts on issues in their communities or in the 
position to take action on topics of online workshops or intiatives 
hosted on Civinomics. 

As a listener, your role is to monitor the online forums related to 
your area, and of course comment and add ideas of your own, if you 
wish. Civinomics provides a convenient way for you to stay current 
with the civic conversations in your community and interact with 
your neighbors and constituents.

Your participation will be of great value to other Civinomics members. 
You can check out the Civinomics activity for your area here:

Best regards,

The Civinomics Team
