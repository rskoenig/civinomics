Hello,

${c.sender} has invited you to be a listener in the Civinomics 
workshop "${c.workshop}", an online space for civic 
improvement.

Listeners are experts on a workshop's topic or in the position to 
take action on a workshop's outcomes. You were probably invited 
because you fit this description. The listeners role is not to 
moderate but to observe, and of course comment and add ideas 
if you wish.

Your participation would be of great value to other Civinomics 
members. Please join the workshop today!
