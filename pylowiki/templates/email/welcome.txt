Welcome!

Congratulations on joining Civinomics, where groups of people come together online to make decisions that lead to action. Now that you're a member, you can:

- Find workshops on topics you care about and contribute your input;

- Submit your ideas and vote on other people's ideas;  

- Create your own workshops on the issues that matter to you and your community.

Whether you're planning an excursion with friends, hammering out company policy or figuring out how to clean up the streets of your town, a Civinomics online workshop can help you organize ideas and information resources, identify the best ideas and take action to benefit your community.

Here are some tips to help you get your bearings:

1. The green Civinomics icon in the upper left corner will always take you to the home page. This page lists all workshops.

2. Use the geographic tags across the top of the home page to find workshops in your zip code, city, county, etc. Click into a workshop to read more about it. If you want to keep tabs on it, Bookmark it.

3. To vote on ideas in a workshop, click on the Ideas tab and use the up/down chevrons. Or add your own idea by clicking the green Add an Idea button.

4. Use your Profile page.  This is where you can find a history of everything that you've ever done --comments made, brilliant suggestions proposed, great resources linked and workshops bookmarked (under the "My Workshops" tab). To get there, click on Profile in the top navigation bar.

5. To create a workshop, click on Workshops in the top navigation bar and select Create. To edit or manage a workshop you've created, go to that workshop and click on the gear symbol (visible to your eyes only).

6. When in doubt, check the Help section. We have an extensive FAQ page. Use it!


That should be enough to get you started. See you online soon!
