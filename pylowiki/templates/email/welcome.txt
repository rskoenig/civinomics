Welcome!

Civinomics hosts online workshops, where members contribute
ideas, conversation, and information resources towards the
goals of the workshop.

Your member profile is a very important place. It includes
links to every item you author as well as all of the workshops
you've bookmarked and all the other members you follow.

You are encouraged to participate in public workshops or private
workshops to which you've been invited. Or, create your own workshop!
Remember to be civil in how you participate, we want Civinomics
to be devoted to collaborating effectively together to make things
better.

Have fun!

The Civinomics team
