${c.numInvitesMessage}

Listeners are experts on a workshop's topic or in the position to take 
action on a workshop's outcomes. You were probably invited because you 
fit this description. The listener's role is not to moderate but to 
observe, and of course comment and add ideas if you wish.

Your participation would be of great value to other Civinomics members. 
Please join the workshop today!
